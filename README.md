## Overview
The project that is motivated by the fact that github actions system lacks
some brief consize representation.
It aims to provide wrapper CLI or just library for interacting with Github Actions API.

TODO
Optionally it can provide server binary to run and account for all failures
across workflows, runs and jobs in one repo.


## Status
Highly WIP!!!
But it is more of a hobby project anyway.
